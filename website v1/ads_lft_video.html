                        <p> We want the ads you see on Doorble to be personalized to your interests and to introduce you to new things. Here are some ways we show you ads that we think may be interesting to you:
                          
                          <h2>Your activity on Doorble:</h2>
                          Some of your activity on Doorble may help us show you ads that we think you might be interested in. A few ways we may show you ads using this information include:
                          
                        
                          <h3>Interests and categories.</h3> Some information you give us may help us think you’re interested in something, like cooking or fitness, or that you might be part of a larger group (called a category), like a mobile user. We can use your interests and categories to connect you with businesses who we think you might be interested in.
                          A few things we could use that help us add you to an interest or category:
                          
                          <ol >
                          <li>Pages on Doorble you've liked.</li>
                          <li>Information from your Doorble profile.</li>
                          <li>Ads you’ve clicked on.</li>
                          <li>The content of posts you've made or interacted with across Doorble.</li>
                          <li> Places you’ve checked in using Doorble.</li>

                          </ol>
                          
                          <h3>Similar Audiences.</h3> A Similar Audience is a way for advertisers to use Doorble to reach people that may be similar to people that have already shown an interest in their business. We use some of the things you do or information you give us to help create Similar Audiences.
                          For example, an advertiser might tell us they’d like to show ads to people who may be similar to people who are already interested in their business (such as people who’ve liked their Page or visited their website). We match things like the interests or demographics (example: your city) of the people who are already interested in the business to help show ads to other people that we think might be interested in the advertiser’s business or products.
                          
                          <h2>Your activity with other businesses:</h2>
                          <h3>DIY Audiences.</h3> DIY Audiences are a way for advertisers to show their ads to a group of people who may have already interacted with their business. A few ways we help advertisers make DIY Audiences:
                          <br>
                          <h3>Your activity on a business’s website or app.</h3> Advertisers can choose to add our Business Tools, to their website or app. These tools allow the advertiser to send information about people's interactions on their website or app to Doorble, such as when someone makes a purchase or opens their app. This helps us show you ads that we think may be interesting to you.
                          <ol>
                          <li><h3>Lists from a business.</h3> Advertisers may get information from you (like your email address) when you interact with them outside of Doorble, like if you make a purchase in their store or create an account for a rewards program. They can create a list with that information and upload it to Doorble. We can match users using the list to help the advertiser reach people who may be interested in their business and without Doorble learning any new identifying information about you. If you see another company using a list for an advertiser, it's likely because the advertiser is working with an advertising agency. For example, if Company X hires Agency Y to run its ads, Agency Y would upload its own list to Doorble and Company X would use that list to show you ads. 
                          </li>
                            <li><h3>Offline activity.</h3> Offline activity is activity you may do in a store, like make a purchase. If a business gives us this information, we can use it to help show their ads to people who may be interested in their business. We can also help businesses reach the right people by letting them know if their customers have engaged with their ads on Doorble.
                            </li></ol>
                          <h2>Location information:</h2>
                          We may use your location information to show you ads from advertisers trying to reach people in or near a specific place. We get this information from things such as:
                          <ol><li>Where you connect to the internet.
                          </li><li>Where you use your phone.
                          </li><li>Your location from your Doorble profile.
                          </li></ol>
                          <h2>Ways to review and manage your information:</h2>
                          <ol>
                          </li><li>Hide an ad that isn't interesting or useful to you or review why you're seeing a particular ad.
